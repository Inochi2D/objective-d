# Objective-D

Objective-D provides essential bindings to Objective-C's Runtime API as well as as the
Foundation framework.

## NOTE

This relies on a D compiler which supports generating Objective-C compatible objects.
Eg. DMD for x86_64 macs, or LDC with [This PR](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/pull/4777).
